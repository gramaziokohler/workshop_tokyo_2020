# Docker compose: UR5 by Universal Robots

The `docker-compose.yml` file in this folder defines all required containers to execute ROS, MoveIt! and the description models of a UR5.

To start it up there are two options:

* Open the file in Visual Studio Code, right-click and select `Compose Up`.
* From the command prompt, change into this directory (`cd`) and execute `docker-compose up -d`.
